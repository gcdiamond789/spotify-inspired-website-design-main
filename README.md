# Design inspired by the Spotify Website
`This repository includes frontend design and development for one of the random landing page designs of the Spotify music streaming platform. 
It explores responsive web-designing and development, where I have built standard designs in Figma and then written the CSS and HTML codes.`  

This design is deployed using GitHub through Netlify: https://spotifyinspiredwesbite.web.app/
